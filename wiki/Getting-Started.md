## Your First Duck

When you start a new game, you'll meet Cheese - a brand new duckling ready for adventure!

```text
            .---.
           / o   \      <-- This is Cheese!
          |   __  |
           \  \_) |>
            `---|--'
              _|  \
             (_)  (_)
```

## Understanding Needs

Your duck has five basic needs that you must keep balanced:

|   Energy    |   Let your duck rest when tired        |
|   Fun       |   Play games and explore               |
|   Clean     |   Keep those feathers pristine         |
|   Social    |   Talk and interact with Cheese        |
+-------------+----------------------------------------+

- Explore new areas beyond the pond
